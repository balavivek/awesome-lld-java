### Introduction to Concurrent Collections in Java

Java provides several concurrent collections in the `java.util.concurrent` package that are designed to handle concurrent access by multiple threads. These collections are thread-safe and provide better performance compared to synchronized collections.

### Real-Time Scenario: Inventory Management System

Let's consider a real-time scenario where an inventory management system needs to handle concurrent updates to the inventory by multiple threads. We'll use `ConcurrentHashMap` to manage the inventory.

#### InventoryManager Class

The `InventoryManager` class uses a `ConcurrentHashMap` to manage the inventory of products.

[InventoryManager.java](../../java/src/awesome/lld/fundamentals/concurrency/concurrentcollections/InventoryManager.java)


#### InventoryApp Class

The `InventoryApp` class demonstrates the usage of `ConcurrentHashMap` to manage the inventory concurrently.

### Explanation

- **ConcurrentHashMap:** A thread-safe implementation of `HashMap` that allows concurrent read and write operations.
- **ConcurrentMap:** An interface that extends `Map` and provides additional atomic operations for concurrent access.
- **ExecutorService:** Manages a pool of worker threads to execute tasks concurrently.

### Key Concepts

- **Thread-Safe Collections:** Collections that can be safely accessed and modified by multiple threads concurrently.
- **Atomic Operations:** Operations that are performed as a single, indivisible step, ensuring data consistency.

By using concurrent collections like `ConcurrentHashMap`, you can efficiently manage shared data in a multi-threaded environment, ensuring thread safety and improving performance.
