### Introduction to the Executor Framework in Java

The Executor Framework in Java provides a higher-level API for managing threads and tasks. It simplifies the process of creating, managing, and coordinating multiple threads, making it easier to build concurrent applications.

### Real-Time Scenario: Processing Orders in an E-commerce System

Let's consider a real-time scenario where an e-commerce system needs to process multiple orders concurrently. We'll use the Executor Framework to manage a pool of worker threads that process these orders.

#### OrderProcessor Class

The `OrderProcessor` class implements the `Runnable` interface to define a task that processes an order.

#### ECommerceApp Class

The `ECommerceApp` class demonstrates the usage of the Executor Framework to process multiple orders concurrently.

### Explanation

- **ExecutorService:** An interface that provides methods to manage the execution of tasks.
- **Executors.newFixedThreadPool:** Creates a thread pool with a fixed number of threads.
- **submit:** Submits a task for execution.
- **shutdown:** Initiates an orderly shutdown of the executor service.

### Key Concepts

- **Thread Pool:** A pool of worker threads that can be reused to execute multiple tasks.
- **Task Submission:** Tasks are submitted to the executor for execution.
- **Graceful Shutdown:** The executor service can be shut down gracefully, allowing previously submitted tasks to complete.

By using the Executor Framework, you can efficiently manage a pool of worker threads and execute tasks asynchronously, improving the performance and scalability of your applications.
