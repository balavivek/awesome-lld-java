### Introduction to Fork/Join Framework in Java

The Fork/Join Framework in Java is designed to take advantage of multiple processors. It is used to break down a task into smaller subtasks, execute them in parallel, and then combine the results. This framework is particularly useful for tasks that can be divided into smaller, independent subtasks.

### Real-Time Scenario: Parallel Array Sum

Let's consider a real-time scenario where we need to calculate the sum of a large array of integers. Using the Fork/Join Framework, we can divide the array into smaller parts, sum them in parallel, and then combine the results.

#### ArraySumTask Class

The `ArraySumTask` class extends `RecursiveTask` to define a task that calculates the sum of a portion of the array.

#### ForkJoinApp Class

The `ForkJoinApp` class demonstrates the usage of the Fork/Join Framework to calculate the sum of a large array.

### Explanation

- **RecursiveTask\<T\>:** A task that returns a result and can be divided into smaller subtasks.
- **ForkJoinPool:** A specialized thread pool designed for the Fork/Join Framework.
- **fork():** Asynchronously executes a subtask.
- **join():** Waits for a subtask to complete and retrieves its result.
- **invoke():** Submits a task to the pool and waits for its completion.

### Key Concepts

- **Divide and Conquer:** Break down a large task into smaller, independent subtasks.
- **Parallel Execution:** Execute subtasks in parallel to improve performance.
- **Result Combination:** Combine the results of subtasks to get the final result.

By using the Fork/Join Framework, you can efficiently perform parallel computations, making your applications more responsive and faster.
