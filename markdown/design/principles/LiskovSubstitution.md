### Introduction to Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) is one of the SOLID principles of object-oriented design. It states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. In other words, subclasses should be able to substitute their base classes.

### Real-Time Scenario: Notification System

Let's consider a real-time scenario where we have a notification system. We'll apply LSP to ensure that different types of notifications can be used interchangeably without affecting the notification sending logic.

#### Notification Interface

The `Notification` interface defines a method for sending notifications.

[Notification.java](../../../java/src/awesome/lld/design/principles/lsp/Notification.java)


#### EmailNotification Class

The `EmailNotification` class implements the `Notification` interface for sending email notifications.

[EmailNotification.java](../../../java/src/awesome/lld/design/principles/lsp/EmailNotification.java)


#### SMSNotification Class

The `SMSNotification` class implements the `Notification` interface for sending SMS notifications.

[SMSNotification.java](../../../java/src/awesome/lld/design/principles/lsp/SMSNotification.java)


#### PushNotification Class

The `PushNotification` class implements the `Notification` interface for sending push notifications.

[PushNotification.java](../../../java/src/awesome/lld/design/principles/lsp/PushNotification.java)


#### NotificationService Class

The `NotificationService` class uses the `Notification` interface to send notifications.

[NotificationService.java](../../../java/src/awesome/lld/design/principles/lsp/NotificationService.java)


### Explanation

- **Notification Interface:** Defines a contract for sending notifications.
- **EmailNotification Class:** Implements the `Notification` interface for sending email notifications.
- **SMSNotification Class:** Implements the `Notification` interface for sending SMS notifications.
- **PushNotification Class:** Implements the `Notification` interface for sending push notifications.
- **NotificationService Class:** Uses the `Notification` interface to send notifications.

By applying LSP, you can use any subclass of `Notification` (e.g., `EmailNotification`, `SMSNotification`, `PushNotification`) with the `NotificationService` class without affecting its behavior, ensuring that the system remains correct and maintainable.

The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) offers several benefits when applied to real-world applications:

1. **Improved Code Reusability**: By ensuring that subclasses can be used interchangeably with their base classes, LSP promotes code reuse. This allows developers to create more generic and flexible code.

2. **Enhanced Maintainability**: Adhering to LSP makes the codebase easier to maintain. Changes in subclasses do not require modifications in the code that uses the base class, reducing the risk of introducing bugs.

3. **Increased Extensibility**: LSP facilitates the addition of new functionalities. New subclasses can be introduced without altering existing code, making the system more extensible.

4. **Better Testability**: Code that follows LSP is easier to test. Subclasses can be tested independently, and the base class tests can be reused for subclasses, ensuring consistent behavior.

5. **Reduced Coupling**: LSP helps in reducing the coupling between classes. By relying on abstractions (base classes or interfaces) rather than concrete implementations, the system becomes more modular and easier to manage.

6. **Consistency and Predictability**: Ensuring that subclasses behave consistently with their base classes leads to more predictable and reliable software. This consistency is crucial for building robust systems.

In summary, applying the Liskov Substitution Principle leads to more robust, maintainable, and scalable software systems, which are easier to extend and test.
