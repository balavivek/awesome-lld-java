### Introduction to Singleton Design Pattern

The Singleton Design Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This is useful in scenarios where exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

### Real-Time Scenario: Database Connection Manager

Let's consider a real-time scenario where we have a database connection manager. We'll apply the Singleton pattern to ensure that only one instance of the connection manager exists, which manages the database connections.

#### DatabaseConnectionManager Class

The `DatabaseConnectionManager` class will be implemented as a Singleton to manage database connections.

[DatabaseConnectionManager.java](../../../java/src/awesome/lld/design/patterns/singleton/DatabaseConnectionManager.java)


### Explanation

- **Private Constructor:** Prevents instantiation from other classes.
- **Static Instance:** Holds the single instance of the class.
- **Synchronized getInstance Method:** Ensures thread safety when creating the instance.
- **getConnection Method:** Provides a method to get a database connection.

By applying the Singleton pattern, we ensure that only one instance of `DatabaseConnectionManager` exists, which manages the database connections efficiently.


### Real-Time Scenario: Logger

Let's consider a real-time scenario where we have a logger. We'll apply the Singleton pattern to ensure that only one instance of the logger exists, which manages logging throughout the application.

#### Logger Class

The `Logger` class will be implemented as a Singleton to manage logging.

[Logger.java](../../../java/src/awesome/lld/design/patterns/singleton/Logger.java)


### Explanation

- **Private Constructor:** Prevents instantiation from other classes.
- **Static Instance:** Holds the single instance of the class.
- **Synchronized getInstance Method:** Ensures thread safety when creating the instance.
- **log Method:** Provides a method to log messages.

By applying the Singleton pattern, we ensure that only one instance of `Logger` exists, which manages logging efficiently throughout the application.
