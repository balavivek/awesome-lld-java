# Inheritance Examples in Java

This project demonstrates the usage of inheritance in Java through practical examples. Inheritance allows one class to inherit properties and methods from another class, promoting code reuse and a hierarchical class structure.

## Examples

### 1. Car Example

The `Car` class represents a basic car with properties like manufacturer, year, model, and number of doors. It includes methods to start the engine, honk, and stop the engine.

### 2. LuxuryCar Example

The `LuxuryCar` class extends the `Car` class, adding additional features like seat type. It inherits the properties and methods of the `Car` class and adds its own unique behavior.

**Code:**
- [InheritanceExamples.java](../../java/src/awesome/lld/java/oop/inheritance/InheritanceExamples.java)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the Java files using your preferred IDE or command line.
4. Run the `InheritanceExamples` class to see the inheritance implementations in action.

## Key Concepts

- **Inheritance:** Allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class.
- **Code Reuse:** Promotes reuse of existing code, reducing redundancy.
- **Hierarchical Class Structure:** Enables the creation of a hierarchical structure of classes, making the code more organized and maintainable.
